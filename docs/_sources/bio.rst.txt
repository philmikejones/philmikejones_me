About
*****

I write code to analyse spatial and non–spatial data sets.
I release as much as I can under open–source licenses.
I am the author of `rakeR <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rakeR>`_, an ``R`` package for simulating spatial data.
You can see some of my other `code projects <https://github.com/philmikejones>`_ on GitHub.

Education
*********

I have a PhD in human geography from the University of Sheffield (2018).
My thesis is, 'A Spatial Microsimulation Analysis of Health Inequalities and Health Resilience'.
You can `read the manuscript <http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/19283>`_ or `view the source code <https://github.com/philmikejones/thesis>`_.
I was supervised by Professors `Dimitris Ballas <https://www.rug.nl/staff/d.ballas/cv?lang=en>`_ and `Liddy Goyder <https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/scharr/sections/ph/staff/profiles/liddy>`_, with support from `Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council <http://www.doncaster.gov.uk/>`_, especially Laurie Mott.

I have an MA with distinction in social research from the University of York (2010), and a BA (Hons) in Sociology from the University of York (2005).
