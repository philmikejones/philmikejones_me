   bio


I write code to analyse spatial and non–spatial data sets. You can see
some of my `code projects <https://github.com/philmikejones>`__ on
GitHub.
   
I have a PhD in human geography. You can `read the
manuscript <http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/19283>`__ or `view
the source code <https://github.com/philmikejones/thesis>`__.

I’ve written several related `tutorials <tutorials/>`__ and `blog
posts <blog/>`__ you can read, use, and share for free (`CC
BY-NC <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/>`__). My
`stats101 <https://philmikejones.github.io/stats101/>`__ website might
also be useful if you want an introduction to statistics (written with
Python).

I am currently a lecturer in policing (research methods) at the
`University of Derby <https://www.derby.ac.uk/>`__. Previously I worked
on the “`Long-term impacts of ‘Thatcherism’: crime, politics and
inequality <https://www.derby.ac.uk/research/showcase/thatcherism-and-crime/>`__”
project.
