This is the code for my website, [philmikejones.me](https://philmikejones.me)

It's built with [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
It uses the [Beautiful Hugo](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo) theme.
I use [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) for writing R posts.
