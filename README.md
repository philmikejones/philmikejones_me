## philmikejones.me

This is the code for my website, [philmikejones.me](https://philmikejones.me)

It's built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) and uses [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html).
I convert `R` code to `rst` with `pandoc`.
