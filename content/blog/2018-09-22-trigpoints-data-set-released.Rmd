I've packaged up the Ordnance Survey's [archive of trig points](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/gps/legacy-control-information/triangulation-stations) into an R package for immediate download and use with R.

Install it with:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("trigpoints")
```

Load it as you would a normal package (I also load a few other useful packages here):

```{r load}
library("trigpoints")
library("dplyr")
library("sf")
```

Check it's loaded correctly:

```{r view}
trigpoints
```

And a quick (ish) plot:

```{r plot, out.width="720px"}
plot(trigpoints, max.plot = 1)
```

The coordinates are projected and stored in OSGB36 British National Grid, for plotting with most OS or other UK shapefiles.
However, these are incompatible with most web--based providers tiles so transform them if you want to plot with these:

```{r transform}
trigpoints =
  trigpoints %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 4326)
```

Before we plot these there are far too many to plot interactively, so instead I plot a random selection:

```{r sample}
trigpoints =
  trigpoints %>% 
  sample_frac(0.1)
```

I also remove any trigpoints that have been destroyed, and keep only those that are the iconic 'Hotine' pillar style:

```{r destroyed-pillar}
trigpoints =
  trigpoints %>%
  filter(destroyed == 0L) %>%
  filter(type == "PILLAR")
```

Now we can plot these on a basemap:

```{r basemap, out.width="720px"}
# install.packages("leaflet")
library("leaflet")

map =
  leaflet(trigpoints, width = 720) %>%
  addMarkers(popup = ~ paste0(
    htmltools::htmlEscape(name),
    "<br />",
    "Height: ",
    htmltools::htmlEscape(height), " m")
  ) %>% 
  addTiles()  

map
```

## Notes

- This data set is no longer maintained by Ordnance Survey so stations marked as not destroyed might no longer exist.
- The coordinates specified are not true OSGB36 National Grid coordinates. They are expected to be accurate to within a metre so will be fine for most purposes.
