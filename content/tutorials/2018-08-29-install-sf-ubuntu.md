If you receive errors about `udunits2` or `gdal-config` when installing `sf` in Ubuntu, this tutorial shows you how to fix them.

## `udunits2`

Here's the `udunits2` error:

```r
checking udunits2.h usability... no
checking udunits2.h presence... no
checking for udunits2.h... no
checking udunits2/udunits2.h usability... no
checking udunits2/udunits2.h presence... no

configure: error: in `/tmp/RtmpLjOYHU/R.INSTALL9fb6a264546/units':
configure: error:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  libudunits2.so not found!

  If the udunits2 library is installed in a non-standard location, use:

    --configure-args='--with-udunits2-lib=/usr/local/lib'

  for example, if the library was not found, and/or

    --configure-args='--with-udunits2-include=/usr/include/udunits2'

  if the header was not found, replacing paths with appropriate values for your
  installation. You can alternatively use the UDUNITS2_INCLUDE and UDUNITS2_LIBS
  environment variables.

  If udunits2 is not installed, please install it.
  It is required for this package.
