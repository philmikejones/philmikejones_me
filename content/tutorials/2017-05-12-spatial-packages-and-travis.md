A number of `R` spatial libraries have been updated in the last couple of weeks, and this has played havoc with my Travis--CI build.
I had still been using Ubuntu Trusty with Travis which uses old versions of libraries like `rgdal` and `rgeos`, so I needed to move to updated versions of these.
In addition `sf` has now become a dependency for a number of spatial packages like `tmap`, and this uses `libudunits2-dev` which isn't installed by default.

To solve all these problems at once as simply as possible, I switched to using a docker container within Travis so I could use an Ubunutu 16.04 ('Xenial') build.
This meant I was able to upgrade to more up--to--date versions of most packages.
I installed the `ubuntugis-unstable` ppa to use the most recent versions of `gdal`, `geos`, and `proj`.
I finally installed `libudunits2` so I could update `sf`.

The docker container is a bit slower (6 minutes vs 3 minutes) but will hopefully speed up with caching.

The final `.travis.yml` looked like this (I've removed my notification options and coverage report token for clarity):

```yaml
sudo: required

services:
  - docker

language: r
cache: packages

before_install:
  - "docker pull ubuntu:16.04"
  - sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable -y
  - sudo apt-get --yes --force-yes update -qq
  - sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev libgeos-dev libproj-dev libudunits2-dev libv8-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libjq-dev

r_packages:
  - sp
  - rgdal
  - rgeos
```
