Geocoding is the process of taking an address, postcode, or other human--readable identifier and converting it into coordinates.
Here I use the [Google Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro) which I access within R with the [`googleway`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=googleway) package.

## Obtain a Google Geocoding API key

To use the Google Geocoding API service we need an API key:

- Open the [Get API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key) page
- Click Get Started
- When asked, you need to enable the `Places` product. Tick this and press Continue
- Select or create a project. If this is the first time you're using this service you will need to create a new project. Type a project name and press Next
- You'll need to set up a billing account and provide a debit or credit card. You can limit the API key use, but I can't see a way around having to provide it.
- Follow the prompts and click Next or Continue
- You'll be told, 'You're all set', and be presented with your API key.

### Restrict the API key

At this point it's worth limiting your API key to prevent misuse.

- You can [set up a cap on usage](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/capping-api-usage) to make sure you don't overspend. Recommended.
- You *should* [restrict use of your API key](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys?hl=en-GB#api_key_restrictions), for example for requests to only originate from your domain or computer.
    - Click on Navigation menu (<i class="fa fa-bars"></i>) > APIs & Services > Credentials
    - Click on Edit API Key (<i class="fa fa-edit"></i>)
    - At the very least, click on API restrictions and restrict your API key to only the Geocoding API
    - You can optionally set Application restrictions, such as permitting queries only from a specific IP address (useful if you have a fixed IP)


## Using your key

I find the easiest way to use the API key is to store it in a text file that is not kept with your data analysis.
That way you can still share the data analysis script or results without sharing the key.

For example, I add `keys/` to `.gitignore` so that folder isn't tracked and shared, and place my key in there.
Load it with `readLines()`:

```{r load-key, echo=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
gkey = readLines("../../keys/geocode_api_key.txt", n = 1)
```


## Packages

If you need to, install googleway:

```{r install}
# install.packages("googleway")
```




## Set up your human--readable addresses

You now need to wrangle your address data into a form the Geocoding API can understand.
For example, it's common to have a data base with a field for town and a field for country, like the `addresses` data base below:

```{r address-database, echo=FALSE}
addresses = data.frame(
    town    = c("Sheffield", "Manchester", "Glasgow", "Cardiff"),
    country = c("England", "England", "Scotland", "Wales"),
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

pander(addresses)
```

The Geocoding API expects a single string per query, so we need to join the two items.
As it happens, `paste0()` is vectorised:

```{r concat-addresses, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
address_strings = paste0(addresses$town, ", ", addresses$country)
address_strings
```

`addresses` is now ready to geocode.


## Storing the results

I don't know of a vectorised way to geocode a number of addresses, so I'm going to use a `for()` loop.
We're limited to the number of times we can query the API server per second anyway, so this isn't going to be a problem.

As with all `for()` loops in R, we should create an empty vector and replace values rather than append each time.
See [Efficient R Programming ](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/programming.html#memory-allocation) for why this is a good idea.

```{r pre-allocate-vectors, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
lat = vector("numeric", length = nrow(addresses))
lng = vector("numeric", length = nrow(addresses))
```


## Geocode

To perform the actual geocoding, we loop over `address_strings` and append the latitude and longitude coordinates to our pre--allocated vectors.
I also check that the query returned `OK`; if it hasn't I simply enter a missing value (`NA`) which can be fixed later (manually if necessary).
Finally, sometimes the API returns multiple results so I've selected the first one.
This tends to happen if the query isn't specific enough (for example 'Manchester' might return Manchester, UK and Manchester, New Hampshire, USA).
Again, these can be fixed later if necessary.

```{r geocode, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
for (i in 1:nrow(addresses)) {
  coord = googleway::google_geocode(address_strings[i], key = gkey)

  if (coord$status == "OK") {
    coord = googleway::geocode_coordinates(coord)
    lat[i] = coord$lat[1]  # sometimes returns multiple coordinates
    lng[i] = coord$lng[1]  # sometimes returns multiple coordinates
  } else {
    lat[i] = NA
    lng[i] = NA
  }

}
```

```{r load-geocoded-results, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# cached the geocoded results so I don't have to keep running the query
lat = readRDS("../../static/data/lat_geocoded.rds")
lng = readRDS("../../static/data/lng_geocoded.rds")
```

We can then append our coordinates to our original data frame (`addresses`):

```{r append-coords, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
addresses$lat = lat
addresses$lng = lng

addresses
```
