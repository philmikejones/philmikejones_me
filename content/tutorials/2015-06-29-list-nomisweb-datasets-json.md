You can use the [Nomisweb API](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/api/v01/help) to discover (list) datasets and to obtain them once you have identified what you need.
The API supports a variety of formats but in this tutorial I use [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) because it's less verbose than other formats so is a smaller file.

## `jq` and `curl`

To list all the available datasets I used a programme called `jq` ('Json Query' I assume).
You can install `jq` on an Ubuntu machine with `sudo apt install jq` or `sudo snap install jq`.
You should install a version >= 1.5.
You will also need `curl` (`sudo apt install curl`).

The following script uses curl and jq to obtain and filter the results, retaining ID, name, and description.
It then saves the output to `nomisweb-datasets.txt`:

- Line 1 specifies which shell to use.
- Line 2 specifies the relevant json file listing all the datasets, specified in the API documentation.
- Line 3 is a series of filters piped together. It essentially obtains everything; then filters out everything but `keyfamilies` at that level; then filters everything but `keyfamily` (it just so happens there's nothing to filter at that level); then obtains all datasets ('`.[]`'); before finally extracting the id, name, and description from each index.
- Line 4 saves this to the file rather than print it to the terminal window as is the default.


## `nomisr`

If you're an R user, querying and obtaining data from the Nomis API is now even easier with the [`nomisr` package](https://docs.evanodell.com/nomisr/).
