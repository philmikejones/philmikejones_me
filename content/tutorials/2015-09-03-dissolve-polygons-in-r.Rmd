Dissolving polygons is an elementary GIS task that I need to perform regularly.
A dissolve removes internal boundaries, leaving only the outline.

## Packages

Install and load the packages we'll need.
I use `sf` because it's more intuitive than `rgdal`, and I'm loading `tidyverse` because it plays well with `sf`.

```{r packages, message=FALSE}
# install.packages(c("tidyverse", "sf"))

library("tidyverse")
library("sf")
```

## Boundary data

Download the shapefile we're going to dissolve.

```{r download-files, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
tmp_dir = tempdir()
tmp     = tempfile(tmpdir = tmp_dir, fileext = ".zip")

download.file(
  "http://census.edina.ac.uk/ukborders/easy_download/prebuilt/shape/England_gor_2011.zip",
  destfile = tmp
)
unzip(tmp, exdir = tmp_dir)
```

And now load the shapefile we just extracted and plot it to ensure it's worked:

```{r load-shapefiles, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
regions = read_sf(tmp_dir, "england_gor_2011")
ggplot(regions) + geom_sf()
```

Now lets have a look at the data (without the geometry):

```{r inspect-regions-data, cache=TRUE}
regions %>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL) %>%
  glimpse()
```

Dissolves with `sf()` do not save the data frame (other than the geometry column) by default without specifying how to aggregate the data.
Using area as an example:

```{r calc-area, cache=TRUE}
regions$area <- st_area(regions)
regions
```

Now we have something some data that's meaningful to group, we can just use `summarise()` to group the data and perform the dissolve:

```{r dissolve-preserve, cache=TRUE}
england <-
  regions %>%
  summarise(area = sum(area))
```

```{r plot-dissolve-preserve, cache=TRUE}
ggplot(england) + geom_sf()
```

If you don't have or want data to save the dissolve just create a column to `group_by()` so that the features (rows) that are to be grouped together are given the same data:

```{r dissolve-group-country, cache=TRUE}
england <-
  regions %>%
  mutate(country = "england") %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise()
```


## Original `rgdal` instructions

I've archived these in case but I strongly suggest using `sf` now for most GIS tasks in R, including dissolves.

```{r rgdal, eval=FALSE}
# Load a few packages. dplyr makes merges easier
require("rgdal")
require("rgeos")
require("dplyr")

# Use the original English regions shapefile downloaded above:
region = readOGR(tmp_dir, "England_gor_2011")

# Check the shapefile has loaded correctly:
plot(region)

# We're going to dissolve all regions in to one country (England!)
# For this we'll create a lookup table and merge with the spatial data
# Hopefully for your 'real' data you have a lookup table of all polygons and
# their larger geography already!

lu = data.frame()
lu = rbind(lu, region@data)
lu$CODE = as.character(lu$CODE)
lu$NAME = as.character(lu$NAME)
lu$country = NA
lu$country = "England"

# Merge
# We now need to merge the lookup table into our spatial object data frame.
# We should end up with one row per zone to dissolve, each with a reference for the relevant larger geography.
# I think the trick is to make sure the row names match exactly, and if you can match the polygon IDs as well with spChFIDs().
region@data$CODE = as.character(region@data$CODE)
region@data = full_join(region@data, lu, by = "CODE")

# Tidy merged data
region@data = select(region@data, -NAME.x)
colnames(region@data) = c("code", "name", "country")

# Ensure shapefile row.names and polygon IDs are sensible
row.names(region) = row.names(region@data)
region = spChFIDs(region, row.names(region))

# Dissolve
# I use gUnaryUnion() (and indeed I think unionSpatialPolygons() in the maptools package uses this by default).
region = gUnaryUnion(region, id = region@data$country)

# If you want to just plot this using base plot you can stop there.
# If you want to do anything with the data or plot using ggplot you need to recreate the data frame.

# If you want to recreate an object with a data frame make sure row names match
row.names(region) = as.character(1:length(region))

# Extract the data you want (the larger geography)
lu = unique(lu$country)
lu = as.data.frame(lu)
colnames(lu) = "country"  # your data will probably have more than 1 row!

# And add the data back in
region = SpatialPolygonsDataFrame(region, lu)

# Check it's all worked
plot(region)

# And your data frame should look like this:
region@data

##   country
## 1 England
```
