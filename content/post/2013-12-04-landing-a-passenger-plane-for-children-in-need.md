This year for Children in Need I landed a passenger plane at Heathrow airport. You should be relieved to hear it was a virtual plane in a flight simulation at the department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering (ACSE) at the University of Sheffield.

The flight simulator was the full works &#8211; with a cockpit in the middle of a large room, and the walls around the room displaying the view. You stepped in to the cockpit and in to the pilot's seat, and used authentic controls; no computer joystick and small monitor here!

To try the flight simulator landing the participants donated £10 to Children in Need, raising a total of £538, which was fantastic and something I was very excited to be a part of.

The results were published, so below is a nice box and whisker diagram of all the data:

Apparently the scores mean the following (provided by ACSE):

<table  class=" table table-hover" >
  <col style="width:25%;" span="1" /> <col style="width:75%;" span="1" /> <tr>
    <th>
      Below 20
    </th>
    
    <td>
      A major disaster – few, if any, survivors – one sure way to get on page one of the Sun, but for all the wrong reasons – you won't be attending the inquest.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      20-39
    </th>
    
    <td>
      Serious damage to the aircraft – if the impact didn't kill you, the undercarriage coming up from under your seat won't have helped.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      40-49
    </th>
    
    <td>
      The aircraft may be repairable – likely to be sold on to one of the budget airlines for summer trips to Alicante.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      50-59
    </th>
    
    <td>
      The burst tyres will need replacing and the passengers will need a strong drink assuming they were not hit by bottles of gin falling from the overhead lockers caused by the heavy jolt on touchdown.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      60-69
    </th>
    
    <td>
      Passengers will have exchanged worried glances during the landing and those with a nervous disposition will be glad they packed an extra pair of trousers.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      70-79
    </th>
    
    <td>
      An arrival rather than a landing – you're welcome to London Gatwick &#8211; as the pilot probably announced to the startled passengers.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      80-89
    </th>
    
    <td>
      Have you ever considered a career with the airlines?
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      over 90
    </th>
    
    <td>
      Are you sure you didn't accidentally engage the autopilot?
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

I scored 64.92, so apart from a few passengers needing a change of underwear, they all survived. I didn't think that was too bad for my first landing.
