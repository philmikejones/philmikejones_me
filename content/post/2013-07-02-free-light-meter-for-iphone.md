When you're using a camera with no way of metering exposure you need a light meter to avoid guessing or having to rely on the &#8216;[sunny 16](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny_16_rule)&#8216; rule. Light meters can run to hundreds of pounds, and since my camera without light meter cost me £5, I didn't fancy splashing out. Instead I found a free app (add supported, or you can pay $0.99/£0.69 to remove adds) for iPhone that uses the camera to meter light.

It's simply called &#8216;Light Meter' and is [available from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pocket-light-meter/id381698089?mt=8).

When you open the app just select your <a class="zem_slink" title="Film speed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_speed" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">film ISO</a> speed and tap to lock it. You can then change aperture or shutter speed to balance your exposure based on the light reading. With my camera it's even simpler as I have only one shutter speed &#8211; 1/60 &#8211; so I also lock the shutter speed and simply read the aperture value. I do have a bulb mode too so when taking long exposures I can select a small aperture and determine how long I need to older the shutter open for. Simple.

I've found it to be reasonably accurate and not bad for less than a quid!
