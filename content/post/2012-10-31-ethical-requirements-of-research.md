All research should be carried out to the highest ethical standards. It's important to: protect the respondent or respondents; help ensure good quality research; and maintain the integrity of the research industries who depend on goodwill to attract future respondents.

Complying with the ethical guidelines of the [Market Research Society](http://www.mrs.org.uk/standards/codeconduct.htm), [Social Research Association](http://the-sra.org.uk/sra_resources/research-ethics/ethics-guidelines/) or [British Sociological Association](http://www.britsoc.co.uk/media/27107/StatementofEthicalPractice.pdf) is not arduous for a relatively straightforward research project.

Imagine my dismay, then, at reading that [research carried out by the Troubled Families Unit doesn't seem to have thought about the ethical implications of their research](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/oct/24/families-tsar-louise-casey-criticised).

Compounding the issue is that this wasn't a piece of general research, but research where vulnerable members of society were the principal respondent.

Summarising [Nick Bailey's original blog post](http://www.poverty.ac.uk/news-and-views/articles/policy-built-unethical-research) on the subject, the research seems to have made the following crucial errors:

- Respondents were not free to decline to participate or to withdraw, a basic tenet of ethical research.
- Bailey suggests that the identity of the respondents might not be protected.
- The department's definition of &#8216;social research' and defining the research as a &#8216;dipstick/informal information gathering' is dubious.

Neglecting ethical standards has arguably harmed the respondents involved, the social research industry and the government, and I'd certainly take a closer look at the method section and results.

## Getting it Right

Getting the ethics right is so crucial for your research; you can't afford to get it wrong or it will harm your brand. You even need to [consider the ethical needs of a straightforward online survey](http://brainthing.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/importance-of-encrypting-online-survey-data/ "The Importance of Encrypting Online Survey Data").

The easiest way to make sure you meet your ethical obligations is to employ a market research or social research professional. For a minimal cost they can protect your respondents, the industry (which is important to ensure there are respondents in the future) and your brand.
