The Townsend Material Deprivation Score was devised by Townsend et al and uses four Census variables:

  1. Unemployment &#8211; percentage of economically active individuals aged 16-74 who are unemployed.
  2. Car ownership — percentage of private households who do not have access to a car.
  3. Homeownership — percentage of private households not owner-occupied.
  4. Overcrowding — percentage of private households with more than one person per room.
