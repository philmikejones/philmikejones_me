I'm delighted to be exhibiting some of my photographs at the [Brougham Photo Fest](https://www.facebook.com/events/504749009593444/) on Saturday and Sunday 28-29 September 2013, 10am-5pm.

It's the first ever photography festival at [Brougham Hall](http://www.broughamhall.co.uk). It's organised by photographer and writer [Simon Whalley](http://www.simonwhalley.org), who is expecting 20+ photographers to display a sample of their work for the public to view and buy.

It's a free event but donations of Â£2 per person are asked to help support the festival for next year.

### Latest News from Simon

> It's looking like we will have 20 photographers exhibiting, some super photobooks as raffle prizes, an informal discussion on publishing a photobook, and live music on saturday at 1pm from the Misdemeanours. The cafe will be open and the other workshops will be open as part of C-Art, so what's not to like, for a good few hours enjoyment. you might even pick up an early christmas pressie, I'm more of a last minute shopper myself!
