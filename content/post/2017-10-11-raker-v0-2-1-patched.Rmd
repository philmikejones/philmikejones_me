I've patched `rakeR` on CRAN to v0.2.1 to fix a couple of problems in the examples and tests, which were using old labels and failing on some machines (thanks to Derek Atherton for the feedback).

I've also updated the [documentation website](https://philmikejones.github.io/rakeR/) to use the new `pkgdown` template to be consistent with other `R` packages, most notably the tidyverse.

And, that's about it. If you're using v0.2.0 and are happy there are no changes to the API to worry about.

As always, install/update with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rakeR")
```
