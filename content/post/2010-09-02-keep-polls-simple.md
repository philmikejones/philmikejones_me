While doing a bit of research [on the minimum price of alcohol](http://brainthing.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/minimum-alcohol-price-binge-drinking/), I stumbled across this website poll:

<p style="text-align:left;">
  <img class="size-full wp-image-186 aligncenter" title="cosmetic-surgery-bodge" src="https://i1.wp.com/philmikejones.me/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/cosmetic-surgery-bodge.png?fit=337%2C264" alt="Cosmetic Surgery Poll" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/philmikejones.me/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/cosmetic-surgery-bodge.png?w=337 337w, https://i0.wp.com/philmikejones.me/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/cosmetic-surgery-bodge.png?resize=300%2C235 300w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" data-recalc-dims="1" />
</p>

  If you can't read the screenshot, today's poll is: &#8220;Would you ever consider plastic surgery?&#8221; This is a poor question in itself, but lets move on. Possible responses are:
</p>

- Maybe, if it wasn't so expensive.
- Yes I would seriously consider it.
- No way, I'm happy with what I have.
- Yes but I can't afford it.

What, exactly, is the difference between &#8216;maybe, if it wasn't so expensive' and &#8216;yes but I can't afford it'? While there's a slight difference in semantics &#8211; &#8216;yes but I can't afford it' being more decided &#8211; I doubt the average respondent is going to agonise over this. What's wrong with:

- Yes
- No
- Not sure

And if you really, really want to know _why_ people answer the way they do, you need another question.
