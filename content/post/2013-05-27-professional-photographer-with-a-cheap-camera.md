I quite enjoy [DigitalRev TV](http://www.youtube.com/user/DigitalRevCom)&#8216;s irreverent sense of humour, but I especially enjoy these two editions of &#8216;[Pro Photographer, Cheap Camera](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7ECB90D96DF59DE5)&#8216; series.

This episode features <a class="zem_slink" title="Chase Jarvis" href="http://blog.chasejarvis.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Chase Jarvis</a> &#8211; the author of the original [_The Best Camera_](http://thebestcamera.com) website, app and book &#8211; using a Lego camera. It's another bit of irreverent fun, but it does show that you can get good images from even a toy camera.

The second episode features <a class="zem_slink" title="Zack Arias" href="http://www.zarias.com" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Zack Arias</a> and is especially inspiring. He uses a basic camera and one flash to create some truly brilliant images on a photowalk. I think Zack's professional attitude and the images he creates make this edition particularly enjoyable, as well as the fact that it's a type of photography almost anyone can do (i.e. you don't need an expensive studio set up).
