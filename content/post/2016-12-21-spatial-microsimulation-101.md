I recently gave a presentation for analysts and data modellers at the [Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions/about/statistics) introducing the spatial microsimulation technique (specifically the [IPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_proportional_fitting) flavour), and below are the slides I used (use `spacebar` to navigate through the slides):

Much of the content is based on material from _Spatial Microsimulation with R_ by Robin Lovelace and Morgane Dumont ([online content](http://robinlovelace.net/spatial-microsim-book/) | [physical book](https://www.crcpress.com/Spatial-Microsimulation-with-R/Lovelace-Dumont/p/book/9781498711548)) and my own [rakeR package](https://philmikejones.github.io/rakeR/) for R. 

For the presentation I also created a spatial model of tax credits claimants in Doncaster based on data I already had for Doncaster and survey responses from [Understanding Society](https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/). NB: don't use the model results in any analysis; they were created quickly to demonstrate the concept and as such haven't been tested or validated in any way.
