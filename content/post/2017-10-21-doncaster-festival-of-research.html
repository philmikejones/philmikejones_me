<p>On Friday 20 October I was delighted to present a poster at the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/doncasters-festival-of-research-fringe-events-tickets-38004578718#">Doncaster Festival of Research 2017 Fringe Event</a> in Denaby and Cadeby Miner’s Welfare in Denaby Main.</p>
<p>With my poster I tried to summarise my doctoral research, which is challenging because it’s probably most relevant for a policy and practitioner audience. I hope it was useful for the people who came to talk to me about it.</p>
<p>The poster summarised the resilient areas in Doncaster I had calculated with my simulation. Resilient areas were those that had high unemployment or high area deprivation, but low prevalence of clinical depression.</p>
<ul>
<li>Resilient areas are blue</li>
<li>built-up areas are in grey</li>
<li>green spaces are green</li>
<li>GP surgeries are red crosses</li>
<li>and leisure centres are the icon of a person exercising.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the event there were a couple of videos playing with members of the local tenants and residents’ association (TARA) and the bumping space talking about what these groups mean to them.</p>
