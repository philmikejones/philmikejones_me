On Friday 20 October I was delighted to present a poster at the [Doncaster Festival of Research 2017 Fringe Event](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/doncasters-festival-of-research-fringe-events-tickets-38004578718#) in Denaby and Cadeby Miner's Welfare in Denaby Main.

With my poster I tried to summarise my doctoral research, which is challenging because it's probably most relevant for a policy and practitioner audience.
I hope it was useful for the people who came to talk to me about it.

The poster summarised the resilient areas in Doncaster I had calculated with my simulation.
Resilient areas were those that had high unemployment or high area deprivation, but low prevalence of clinical depression.

- Resilient areas are blue
- built-up areas are in grey
- green spaces are green
- GP surgeries are red crosses
- and leisure centres are the icon of a person exercising.

At the event there were a couple of videos playing with members of the local tenants and residents' association (TARA) and the bumping space talking about what these groups mean to them.
