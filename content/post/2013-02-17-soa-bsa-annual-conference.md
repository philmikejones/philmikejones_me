This year my co-convenors of the _Sociologists Outside Academia _group and I submitted a proposal for a presentation at the <a class="zem_slink" title="British Sociological Association" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Sociological_Association" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">British Sociological Association</a>&#8216;s [annual conference](http://www.britsoc.co.uk/events/bsa-annual-conference.aspx) in April. I'm especially excited to be organising the presentation because this will be the first time SOA have presented at the BSA annual conference.

The SOA presentation will be a symposium, that is a short presentation from a number of speakers, followed by a question and answer session. We've invited SOA members to attend and present the nature of their work outside academia and in industry, and I will chair the session.

If you would like to attend you can [register for the annual conference](http://www.britsoc.co.uk/events/bsa-annual-conference/registration.aspx). If you want to register for one day only we're on Wednesday 3 April.

Our submitted abstract:

> ### Sociology Outside Academia: Reflections and Experiences of Working in the Public, VCFS, and Private Sector
> 
> Not all sociologists work in university departments. Sociologists Outside Academia (SOA) does exactly what it says on the tin: we are a group of sociologists who work outside of the academy and SOA provides a 'virtual institution' to support its members and strengthen the idea that we are first and foremost sociologists regardless of our circumstances.
> 
> As a result of carrying out sociological work in a variety of organisations our members have a wealth of experience of the public, private, and VCFS sectors. It is this experience that we wish to share with our colleagues and fellow sociologists working in university departments.
> 
> This symposium will take the format of short presentations from four SOA members about their research interests and careers, followed by a question and answer session where there will be opportunity to ask about the presentations, the nature of working outside academia, and the SOA network.
> 
> This symposium will be an opportunity for sociologists to develop relationships and exchange knowledge regardless of their institution or background.
