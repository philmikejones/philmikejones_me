Yesterday I gave a short talk for the [Sheffield R Users' Group](http://sheffieldr.github.io/) about unit testing in R.

![I find your lack of unit tests disturbing](https://github.com/philmikejones/RUnitTesting/blob/master/img/lack-of-unit-tests-disturbing.png)

In short, there are two things you should really be testing when working in R:

1. Data analysis scripts (usually in `data-raw/`)
1. Functions (usually in `R/`)

Get set up and see some examples at https://philmikejones.github.io/RUnitTesting/
I also shared some examples from [rakeR](https://github.com/philmikejones/rakeR) and my [thesis](https://github.com/philmikejones/thesis).
