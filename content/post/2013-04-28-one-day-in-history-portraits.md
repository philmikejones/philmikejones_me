I wanted to share these portraits by [Andrea Gjestvang](http://andreagjestvang.com) of the survivors of the Ut√∏ya massacre in Norway in 2011. The photographs themselves are beautiful and well-composed, but the stories behind them are also very poignant as a reminder of both the frailty and strength of the survivors.

I thoroughly recommend you have a look and read the stories.

The photograph above is taken from the artist's website to illustrate her collection. It's not one of my own.
