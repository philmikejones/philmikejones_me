I received a link to this survey recently, asking me to rate my experience with a popular brand of sofas and furnishings. While it got a lot of things right, it got a few of the fundamentals wrong.

In case you can't read the screenshot, the two questions are:

  1. Thinking about your overall customer experience, how likely are you to recommend [the company] to friends, family and colleagues? Answers given on a scale of 0 to 10.
  2. Please tell us a little more about why you have given this score.

Using a scale of 0 to 10 is good, and the fact that it's not part of a matrix is even better. The problem with its implementation here is that the scale reads backwards, i.e. from 10 on the left to 0 on the right. I assume this is either an oversight or, if I was feeling cynical, a suggestive way to improve the score.

The scale should always read naturally, i.e. from 0 on the left to 10 on the right, as someone would read a series of numbers in ascending order.

A progress indicator was good to see, as well as the general lack of matrices, so it wasn't all bad. In fact this is one of the better laid-out surveys I've seen recently.
