I am delighted and very proud that I was asked to exhibit some of my photographs from Lesvos for this year's [Migration Matters Festival](http://www.migrationmattersfestival.co.uk/) in Sheffield, which is held as part of [Refugee Week](http://refugeeweek.org.uk/). The festival ran from 17th to 25th June 2016 in [Theatre Delicatessen](http://theatredelicatessen.co.uk/about/the-moor-sheffield/), with exhibitions from other photographers, workshops held by artists, and plays performed by local theatre companies. Sadly because I was recovering from surgery I was unable to attend the talk that my supervisor gave on the evening of the 23rd &#8211; &#8216;[Letters and Pictures from Lesvos](http://www.migrationmattersfestival.co.uk/line-up-2016/)&#8216;, but I was able to at least see the static pieces by other photographers and artists when I visited later in the week.

The festival line up looked superb and the pieces I got to enjoy (i.e. not the performed pieces) were beautiful, some made by refugees who now call Sheffield home. I look forward to next year's festival, even if I'm not invited to exhibit!
