> A World Full of Data: Statistics Opportunities Across A-Level Subjects

The report was completed by Roger Porkess and was based on the [fieldwork I and many others contributed to earlier in the year](http://www.philmikejones.net/enhancing-statistical-knowledge-in-sociology/).

### General Findings

At the launch Roger talked through and discussed many of his general findings that were relevant to most subjects included in the report:

- <div>
      There needs to be better provision of continued professional development (CPD) for teachers to learn statistical skills and be confident teaching statistics.
    </div>

- <div>
      There should be some provision to undertake a research project to experience the statistical research cycle. This could be in the form of coursework or similar provision.
    </div>

- <div>
      He suggested an increased and better use of appropriate software and tools.
    </div>

### Statistical Literacy

I found the emphasis on &#8216;statistical literacy,' rather than simply numeracy, very useful. Clearly numeracy is important, but statistical literacy places an emphasis on developing a confidence with using statistical tests and interpreting their results, especially using software tools.
