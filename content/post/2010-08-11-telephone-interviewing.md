Conducting interviews over the telephone presents a few unique challenges, compared to interviewing in person.
Here are my recommendations for recording the interview and obtaining informed consent.

## Recording

Ordinarily I would record my interviews on a dictaphone with a microphone, which I then transfer to my computer and transcribe.
With a telephone conversation, obviously that's not possible.
My solution was to use a Nokia mobile phone as this has a record option built into the software.
Just open the menu when you're in a call and press 'Record'.

I'm sure there are third--party applications available for BlackBerry and iPhone, but they don't appear to support recording natively.
When you're recording, both parties hear a discreet beep as a reminder that the call is being recorded.
Just make sure you ask permission before you begin recording, which leads me on to the next point.


## Informed Consent

I read out the main points of the informed consent form, and then asked my respondent to say aloud that they agreed to the terms of the form.
I also emailed a blank copy of the informed consent form to my respondent for their reference.
