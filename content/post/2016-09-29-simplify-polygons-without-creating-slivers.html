<p>When you download geographical data the polygons are often highly detailed, leading to large file sizes and slow processing times. Often this detail is unnecessary if you’re not intending to produce small–scale maps. Most thematic maps, for example, tend to compare large geographies such as nations or regions, so the detail is unnecessary. Likewise, if you’re producing your map for use on the web, for example as an interactive visualisation, too much detail can slow the rendering and responsiveness of your app.</p>
<p>Compare the following two plots:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/rgn_simplify.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>It’s practically impossible to tell the difference between the two at this scale, which would be perfectly practical for a web visualisation. The unsimplified file on the left is 13MB, while the simplified image on the right is only 0.15MB!</p>
When simplifying polygons it’s almost inevitable that you will generate some sliver polygons or gaps between the correct polygons. For example, the following image shows two adjoining complex polygons, representing two adjoining administrative areas. Note there are no gaps between the polygons; they are contiguous (the border is between Sheffield and Barnsley LADs, by the way).

Now if we simplify these polygons to reduce their complexity using simplify geometries in QGIS, gaps appear between the original two polygons and they are no longer contiguous.

If you’re just plotting a basic, low resolution thematic map this isn’t necessarily a problem, but it becomes problematic when you try to use these polygons with other data or use the polygons for clipping. There are solutions but correcting them can be a pain, and don’t always work as intended. But why correct them; why not simplify without creating sliver polygons in the first place? If you’re an R user the <code>ms_simplify()</code> function in the <code>rmapshaper</code> package allows you to do exactly that.

Simplified geometries using rmapshaper

</figure>
<p>QGIS’s simplify geometries and rmapshaper::ms_simplify() use different arguments for thresholds, so I’ve matched the level of simplification as best I can to ensure a fair test. The QGIS simplified shapefile is 6.6MB, while the rmapshaper simplified shapefile is 5.7MB (so slightly smaller and still without errors introduced).</p>
<p>To use <code>rmapshaper::ms_simplify()</code> just install and load the library and run it on a <code>spatialPolygons*</code> object:</p>
<pre><code>install.packages(&quot;rmapshaper&quot;)

library(&quot;rmapshaper&quot;)

simplified_shape &lt;- ms_simplify(unsimplified_shape)</code></pre>
