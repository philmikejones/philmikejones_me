After dropping my <a class="zem_slink" title="Digital single-lens reflex camera" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">DSLR</a> again (I should probably invest in a decent strap) I needed to make another repair. This time the back plate became slightly detached from the main body, leaving a small 2 or 3mm gap perfect to let in dust and water.

I enlisted the help of my dad to apply some <a class="zem_slink" title="Silicone rubber" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone_rubber" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">silicone rubber</a> sealant to the gap:

Perhaps not the most aesthetically pleasing or unnoticeable repair ever, but it's probably better weather-sealed than before!
