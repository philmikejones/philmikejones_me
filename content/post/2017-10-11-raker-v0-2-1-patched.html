<p>I’ve patched <code>rakeR</code> on CRAN to v0.2.1 to fix a couple of problems in the examples and tests, which were using old labels and failing on some machines (thanks to Derek Atherton for the feedback).</p>
<p>I’ve also updated the <a href="https://philmikejones.github.io/rakeR/">documentation website</a> to use the new <code>pkgdown</code> template to be consistent with other <code>R</code> packages, most notably the tidyverse.</p>
<p>And, that’s about it. If you’re using v0.2.0 and are happy there are no changes to the API to worry about.</p>
<p>As always, install/update with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;rakeR&quot;)</code></pre>
