I write code to analyse spatial and non--spatial data sets.
You can see some of my [code projects](https://github.com/philmikejones) on GitHub.

I am the author of [`rakeR`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rakeR), an `R` package for simulating spatial data.

I have a PhD in human geography.
You can [read the manuscript](http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/19283)  or [view the source code](https://github.com/philmikejones/thesis).

I'm currently working on the "[Long-term impacts of 'Thatcherism': crime, politics and inequality](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/law/research/projects/crimetrajectories)" project in the [Centre for Criminological Research](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/law/research/clusters/ccr) at the University of Sheffield.
