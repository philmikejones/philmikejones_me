## About

I write code to analyse spatial and non--spatial data sets.
I release as much as I can under open--source licenses.
I am the author of [`rakeR`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rakeR), an `R` package for simulating spatial data.
You can see some of my other [code projects](https://github.com/philmikejones) on GitHub.


## Education

I have a PhD in human geography from the University of Sheffield (2018).
My thesis is entitled, "A Spatial Microsimulation Analysis of Health Inequalities and Health Resilience".
You can [read the manuscript](http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/19283)  or [view the source code](https://github.com/philmikejones/thesis).
I was supervised by Professors [Dimitris Ballas](https://www.rug.nl/staff/d.ballas/cv?lang=en) and [Liddy Goyder](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/scharr/sections/ph/staff/profiles/liddy), with support from [Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council](http://www.doncaster.gov.uk/), especially Laurie Mott.

I have an MA with distinction in social research from the University of York (2010), and a BA (Hons) in Sociology from the University of York (2005).


## Current role

I currently work on the "[Long-term impacts of 'Thatcherism': crime, politics and inequality](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/law/research/projects/crimetrajectories)" project at the [University of Derby](https://www.derby.ac.uk/) in the [Department of Criminology and Social Sciences](https://www.derby.ac.uk/departments/criminology-social-sciences/).
We were previously based at the University of Sheffield.
