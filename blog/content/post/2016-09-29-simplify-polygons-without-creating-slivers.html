<p>When you download geographical data the polygons are often highly detailed, leading to large file sizes and slow processing times. Often this detail is unnecessary if you’re not intending to produce small–scale maps. Most thematic maps, for example, tend to compare large geographies such as nations or regions, so the detail is unnecessary. Likewise, if you’re producing your map for use on the web, for example as an interactive visualisation, too much detail can slow the rendering and responsiveness of your app.</p>
<p>Compare the following two plots:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/rgn_simplify.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>It’s practically impossible to tell the difference between the two at this scale, which would be perfectly practical for a web visualisation. The unsimplified file on the left is 13MB, while the simplified image on the right is only 0.15MB!</p>
<p>With many simplification tools—such as those provided by QGIS or <code>rgeos</code>—slivers and gaps are introduced between polygons. The <code>R</code> package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmapshaper"><code>rmapshaper</code></a> simplifies polygons loaded in <code>sf</code> or <code>sp</code> form without introducing slivers and gaps:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;sf&quot;)
library(&quot;rmapshaper&quot;)

eg = read_sf(&quot;eg.shp&quot;)
eg = ms_simplify(eg)</code></pre>
